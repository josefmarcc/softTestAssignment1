## 3. Give your thoughts on BDD

* What was positive and good about using BDD?
By having tests already created, I can easily identify what part of the code needs refactoring in case of failure.

* What was annoying or difficult?
Takes longer to setup.

* What surprised you?
That it was easy to setup

* Did BDD help you understand the problem domain more
Yes it made me understand the domain better since I had to think of the use cases.

* Did BDD help you write some tests you wouldnâ€™t otherwise have thought of? 
Yes
